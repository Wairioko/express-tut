Project: E-commerce API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB
Objective:
Create a comprehensive backend API for an e-commerce application. This API will handle user authentication, product management, order processing, and include advanced features like payment integration and admin functionalities.

Requirements:
1. Setup:
Create a new Node.js project.
Set up Express.
Connect to a MongoDB database.
2. Models:
User: For customer and admin users.
username: String (required, unique)
email: String (required, unique)
password: String (required)
isAdmin: Boolean (default: false)
Product: For items being sold.
name: String (required)
description: String
price: Number (required)
category: String (required)
stock: Number (default: 0)
Order: For managing purchases.
user: ObjectId (reference to User)
products: Array of objects (each object contains productId and quantity)
totalPrice: Number (calculated)
status: String (enum: ['pending', 'paid', 'shipped', 'delivered'], default: 'pending')
createdAt: Date (default: Date.now)
3. API Endpoints:
User Endpoints:
POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/users/login: Authenticate a user and issue a JWT.
Product Endpoints:
POST /api/products: Create a new product (admin only).
GET /api/products: Get all products.
GET /api/products/:id: Get a single product by ID.
PUT /api/products/:id: Update a product by ID (admin only).
DELETE /api/products/:id: Delete a product by ID (admin only).
Order Endpoints:
POST /api/orders: Create a new order (authenticated users only).
GET /api/orders: Get all orders (admin only).
GET /api/orders/:id: Get a single order by ID (authenticated users only, only their orders or admin).
PUT /api/orders/:id: Update an order status (admin only).
4. Validation:
Ensure that all required fields are validated.
Validate email format and uniqueness for users.
Validate that the product quantity in an order does not exceed available stock.
5. Security:
Hash passwords before storing them in the database.
Use JWT for user authentication.
Protect routes using middleware to check for authentication and authorization.
6. Advanced Features:
Implement pagination for product listing.
Add a search feature to filter products by name or category.
Integrate a payment gateway (like Stripe) to process payments.
Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
7. Testing:
Write comprehensive unit tests for your API endpoints using Mocha or Jest.
Ensure to cover both successful operations and edge cases.
Extra Credit:
Implement a role-based access control system where users can have different roles (e.g., admin, customer, guest).
Add product reviews and ratings.
Send email notifications on order status changes using a service like SendGrid.
Deliverables:
